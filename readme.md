This will be your teams repository for the hackathon. 

Within this repository is a small sample application (in the `./Application` directory) and some infrastructure-as-code (in the `./InfrastructureAsCode` directory) that you will use to complete the challenges. Unless told to in the challenges you should not need to modify code files in these directories, however you will likely need to add additional files to this repository to power your Codespaces and your GitHub Actions workflows.

Good luck and have fun hacking!
